    <p>My name is Mike Mead and I live in Wausau, WI with my two kids Mason (16) and Harper (13), and girlfriend Lisa.  I've been in the packaging industry for over 15 years, launched a couple of businesses, and at 41 I'm looking to learn something new.</p>

    <p>My understanding of writing code was pretty limited coming into the class.  Despite having a background in eCommerce, and working with developers for most of my life I've never bothered to learn more about what the developers that I've come to rely on really do. </p>
